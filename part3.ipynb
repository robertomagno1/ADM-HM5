    "3. Finding Best Routes (Q3)\n",
    "Whenever you plan to fly to a specific city, your goal is to find the most efficient and fastest flight to reach your destination. In the system you are designing, the best route is defined as the one that minimizes the total distance flown to the greatest extent possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you need to implement a function that, given an origin and destination city, determines the best possible route between them. To simplify, the focus will be limited to flights operating on a specific day.\n",
    "Note: Each city may have multiple airports; in such cases, the function should calculate the best route for every possible airport pair between the two cities. For example, if city \n",
    "A\n",
    " has airports \n",
    "a\n",
    "1\n",
    ",\n",
    "a\n",

    "2\n",
    ". If it’s not possible to travel from one airport in the origin city to another airport in the destination city on that date, you must report it as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes the following inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flights network\n",
    "Origin city name\n",
    "Destination city name\n",
    "Considered Date (in yyyy-mm-dd format)\n",
    "The function output:\n",
    "\n",
    "A table with three columns: 'Origin_city_airport', 'Destination_city_airport', and the 'Best_route'.\n",
    "Note: In the \"Best_route\" column, we expect a list of airport names connected by \n",
    "→\n",
    ", showing the order in which they are to be visited during the optimal route. If no such route exists, the entry should display \"No route found.\"\n",
